# MyStudentProjects is my personal repository of all the solutions to the tasks I was given in the different courses from the 2 year programme of SoftUni C# Web Development. 

Each course is divided to different topics and every topic has a lecture and excercise.
The lectures are designed to introduce the students to concepts of the topic discussed and the tasks given upon the lecture material 
are usualy only for the purpose of the introduction.
The excercises consist of solving more complex problems and have the purpose of digging deeper into the topic at hand. 

The repository is structured by courses names, topics discussed during the course, Lab and Excercise folders for the different tasks givven.

For Example:

C#/OOP/Inheritance/Lab/MultipleInheritance is a task given from the lectures to introduce the students with the
base concepts of Inheritance.
